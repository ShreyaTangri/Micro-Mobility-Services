# Micro-Mobility-Services

1. Micro mobility services are increasingly being adapted as an alternative transport mode in the urban environments, especially for short trips as it has the 
potential in connecting people better with the public transit, reducing too much dependency on the private cars, and making the most of existing space by 
rearranging the vehicle. 

2. It is an eco-friendly, cost-effective solution to the increasing traffic traffic in the urban areas. These exclusive features of micro-mobility services have 
drawn our attention to conduct a study in this area by collecting data of the active services in different cities in the world, analyzing the impact of these 
services and thus presenting the answers to research questions regarding availability of the bikes, number of trips and about the user preferences. 

3. Our main goals are to provide suggestions to the companies which are operating these bikes as well as to the consumers who are using these bikes.

4. Did an extensive research on micro-mobility services and came out with the few solutions for the companies running these bikes to achieve better utilization 
rates and wrote a short report on our research.
